Her recent HbA1c level is 6.2, and her random glucose measurement is within normal limits. While her current health status appears stable, her HbA1c suggests the need for further evaluation of her metabolic health. I recommend a referral to a specialist for comprehensive assessment and guidance on lifestyle modifications to support her long-term well-being. Continued monitoring and preventive strategies should be emphasized."
